    "details": "Community service is work done by a person or group of people that benefits others. It is often done near the area where you live, so your own community reaps the benefits of your work. You do not get paid to perform community service, but volunteer your time. Community service can help many different groups of people: children, senior citizens, people with disabilities, even animals and the environment. Community service is often organized through a local group, such as a place of worship, school, or non-profit organization, but you can also start your own community service projects. Many people participate in community service because they enjoy helping others and improving their community. Some students are required to do community service in order to graduate high school or to receive certain honors. Some adults are also ordered by a judge to complete a certain number of community service hours.",

    "details": "One main task of a well-organised healthcare system is to effectively diagnose and treat serious diseases in a way that optimises the prognosis. Studies on the diagnosis of cancer suggest that non-conclusive initial visits and a long waiting period for investigations to be performed are likely to delay the diagnosis [1, 2] which may have a negative effect on survival [3, 4]. Up to 2020, we expect to see a 20% increase in the incidence of cancer; a growth that may be attributed to demographic changes and advances in medicine which means that more citizens will be living with cancer [5]. In this context, more knowledge of cancer patients’ patterns of demand for health care services before as well as after their diagnosis is critical to identifying possibilities for improving both patient pathways and health care resource allocation. A major concern in Denmark is that cancer patients have a poorer survival than patients in other European countries [6]. This has partly been explained by delay in cancer diagnosis and treatment [3, 4, 7]. More detailed knowledge of cancer patients’ health care resource demands and utilization patterns around the time of diagnosis may undoubtedly allow us to better organize health care supply and further shorten the time to cancer diagnosis, notably if particular health care utilizations patterns can be identified in large population-based cohorts. Data from such studies may prove even more valuable if combined with information on referral to diagnostic investigations and use of hospital services which would help us identify specific patterns of health care use rooted in current clinical or organizational inexpediencies. Such research would also serve the purpose of further substantiating or qualifying previous research. Apart from a comprehensive British survey which showed much variation in the number of consultations with cancer symptoms before hospital referral for suspected cancer [8], most previous studies have included fewer than 500 cancer patients and have suggested that before the time of diagnosis, cancer patients use their general practitioner (GP) less than controls [9, 10] with GP consultation frequencies peaking in the first month after diagnosis [11]. Once a cancer patient has been diagnosed and treatment has been initiated, cancer trajectories are very different. However, common for all cancers is the claimed lack of primary care involvement after discharge, which may be ascribed to patients being reluctant to go back to primary care and primary care not being there for the patients [12–16]. We therefore need a precise description of cancer patients’ health care usage in primary and secondary care after their cancer diagnosis. Such detailed knowledge would be particularly instrumental in identifying their need for health care services in the period after discharge from hospital. The aim of this study was to describe incident adult cancer patients’ health service utilisation one year prior to and one year after their first cancer diagnosis.",

    "details": "The American College of Surgeons recognizes 14 surgical specialties: cardiothoracic surgery, colon and rectal surgery, general surgery, gynecology and obstetrics, gynecologic oncology, neurological surgery, ophthalmic surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthopaedic surgery, otorhinolaryngology, pediatric surgery, plastic and maxillofacial surgery, urology, and vascular surgery. The information that follows presents information on the various surgical specialties. The material was adapted from definitions put forth by the nationally recognized authority on the topic, the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), and its approved surgical specialty boards. A general surgeon is a specialist who is trained to manage a broad spectrum of surgical conditions affecting almost any area of the body. The surgeon establishes the diagnosis and provides the preoperative, operative, and post-operative care to patients and is often responsible for the comprehensive management of the trauma victim and the critically ill patient. During at least a five-year educational period after obtaining a medical degree, the surgeon acquires knowledge and technical skills in managing medical conditions that relate to the head and neck, breast, skin, and soft tissues, abdominal wall, extremities, and the gastrointestinal, vascular, and endocrine systems. Thoracic surgery involves the operative management, perioperative care, and critical care of patients with pathological conditions within the chest. Specifically, it includes surgical care for coronary artery disease; cancers of the lung, esophagus, and chest wall; abnormalities of the great vessels and heart valves; congenital anomalies; tumors of the mediastinum; and diseases of the diaphragm. The management of the airway and injuries to the chest are also areas of surgical practice for the thoracic surgeon. A thoracic surgeon possesses the knowledge, experience, and technical skill to diagnose accurately, to operate upon safely, and to manage effectively patients with intrathoracic abnormalities that are appropriate for surgical treatment. The ability to provide this kind of treatment requires a substantial knowledge of cardiorespiratory physiology and oncology, as well as capability in the use of extracorporeal circulation, cardiac assist devices, management of cardiac dysrhythmias, pleural drainage, respiratory support systems, endoscopy, and other invasive and noninvasive diagnostic techniques.",

    "details": "Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. It is all about how people think, feel, and behave. People sometimes use the term “mental health” to mean the absence of a mental disorder. Mental health can affect daily living, relationships, and physical health. However, this link also works in the other direction. Factors in people’s lives, interpersonal connections, and physical factors can all contribute to mental health disruptions. Looking after mental health can preserve a person’s ability to enjoy life. Doing this involves reaching a balance between life activities, responsibilities, and efforts to achieve psychological resilience. Conditions such as stress, depression, and anxiety can all affect mental health and disrupt a person’s routine. Although the term mental health is in common use, many conditions that doctors recognize as psychological disorders have physical roots. In this article, we explain what people mean by mental health and mental illness. We also describe the most common types of mental disorders, including their early signs and how to treat them.",

Put simply, rehabilitation helps a child, adult or older person to be as independent as possible in everyday activities and enables participation in education, work, recreation and meaningful life roles such as taking care of family. It does so by addressing underlying conditions (such as pain) and improving the way an individual functions in everyday life, supporting them to overcome difficulties with thinking, seeing, hearing, communicating, eating or moving around. Anybody may need rehabilitation at some point in their lives, following an injury, surgery, disease or illness, or because their functioning has declined with age. Exercises to improve a person’s speech, language and communication after a brain injury. Modifying an older person’s home environment to improve their safety and independence at home and to reduce their risk of falls. Exercise training and education on healthy living for a person with a heart disease. Making, fitting and educating an individual to use a prosthesis after a leg amputation. Positioning and splinting techniques to assist with skin healing, reduce swelling, and to regain movement after burn surgery. Prescribing medicine to reduce muscle stiffness for a child with cerebral palsy. Psychological support for a person with depression. Training in the use of a white cane, for a person with vision loss. Rehabilitation is highly person-centered, meaning that the interventions and approach selected for each individual depends on their goals and preferences. Rehabilitation can be provided in many different settings, from inpatient or outpatient hospital settings, to private clinics, or community settings such as an individual’s home. The rehabilitation workforce is made up of different health workers, including but not limited to physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and audiologists, orthotists and prosthetists, clinical psychologists, physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors, and rehabilitation nurses.",
